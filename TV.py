# Pseudocode

# 1. Create a class and define functions and methods for operating the TV

class TV:
    def __init__(self):
        self.channel = 1
        self.volume_level = 1
        self.on = False
        
# 2. When the class or the blueprint of the TV is done, create another file named test_tv.py to test and produce the channel and volume level of tv 1 and tv 2
